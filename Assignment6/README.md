# Assignment 6
Make an art or a game with objects. See also : Sol LeWitt, or the reCode project for some inspirations. pong or tic tac toe are good places to start as well.

I have extended my happyfaces game to make it ping pongish. The game has 4 paddles, one top, bottom, left and right that follow user's mouse movement. You can set a variable of how many balls you want launched. A ball is launched with each click. Once it hits the paddle it bounces back. You lose if it doesnt hit a paddle.

I am having difficulties with collision detection with the paddles and the wall. Right now it thinks of everything as a paddle. Work in progress.


## Observation assignment:
Go and observe people using an interactive interface in public. Take notes on their experience with it. How did they operate the interafce? Were they successful in completing their interaction? Were their expectations met? Were yours? Write a post about it. Draw or photograph the interface. Video if itâ€™s not stalkery

So I wasnt sure how safe it would be me to go and stare at people in public or worse take their pictures or videotape them. I dont want to end up in Gitmo. However, I noticed how people were interacting with the new Kiosks at Broadway, Lafayetter station. I think more often than note, they were mesmerized by the ads on it to notice the three interaction points which allow for you to check the incoming train times as well as routes. Once they fiddled with it, it was still difficult for them to navigate each screen. It seems a little more work needs to be done in User Interaction design unless ofcourset the purpose was for them to have another places for advertisement. 

People who appeared to be constant users were able to go directly to where they wanted to so it was a trained behavior rather than intuitive design.
