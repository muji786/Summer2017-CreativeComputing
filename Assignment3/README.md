# Assignment 3
Expanding on your switch from last week, make a program with the Arduino that combines multiple switches and outputs. Introduce some 'thought' into your system of input and output. How can you contextualize meaning from a blinking light?

I have tried to make a traffic light using three color LEDs and a switch. A fourth white LED denotes walk sign. The idea is that it will go through a loop of red-yellow-green but when the switch is pressed, it disrupts it and goes to red light with walk sign. Attached is the Arduino code and the video of creation.

I found the video fascinating and the artists journey through technology and using AI to create organic presentations. Somewhat random and chaotic coding can restructure and reorganize into an order that is aesthetically pleasing. Very smart and artistic guy :)
