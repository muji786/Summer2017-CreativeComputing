Make a self portrait or a drawing machine

I took a swipe at using p5.js to get a self portrait. The angle I took was to use the video camera, take a snapshot in the browser and manipulate the pixels in the picture. I am nnot sure if I have been entirely successful. I am able to get an image but all attempts to change pixels have been a failure. I found Dan Schiffman's videos somewhat helpful but still didnt help me with the issue that I am facing. It may have something to do with the draw function which keeps on drawing on the screen. I did find p5 somewhat cumbersome, since my code would work fine on some browsers and some computers while not on others.

I think the author is hedging alot on using our hands. I am sure Stephen Hawking would disagree. So would CEOs of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon who are betting that interacting with machines in a natural language through Echo/Siri/Home etc is the future. I do agree with one of the commentators on the followup article that the future in short term is speaking with technology, and long term may bring interaction through brain waves and thoughts. Interfaces that translate the "needs" via thoughts into materialized actions... 

We do spend most of the time in a cyber world interacting with society around us and seem to be happy with it. The author doesnt like this future where we are immobile. Others might disagree.
