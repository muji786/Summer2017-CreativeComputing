Try and implement two aspects from the 12 principles of animation. Hereâ€™s a 20-ish minute playlist that gets into details about it.

I made an application that spreads happiness in the world. Every time you click, a happy face appears and hopefully stress goes down. I create an object happy face that has two functions. One draws it at the x,y coordinates, move moves it randomly between -1 and 1 of the x,y coordinates. This is my swipe at animation principles. When it touches the canvas boundary, it bounces back. A second step is to be aware of each other and not overlap one another... work in progress

I really enjoyed the concept of human centric design and to incorporate emotional impact when making design decisions. Industrial / Experience / Interaction design lack some of that human centricity and how it affects us as human beings. Designers want to create pleasurable experiences. Sometimes technology is focussed on functional needs and requirements and not necessarily the experience behind it.
