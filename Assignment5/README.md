Make a love machine / stuid pet trick

Its not really a love machine, but a photoresistor sensor based alarm. My daughter's scooter got stolen and I wanted to make something that would measure light and output an alarm if there's a change. Problem.. THe sensor gets saturated very quickly and it keeps on alarming :)
