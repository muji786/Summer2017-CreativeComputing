# Assignment 1
1. Create an online blog for the class.
2. Review the Wrangling Electrons post and create a circuit with a switch and make a post in your blog about it. Can you make the switch close with something so you don't have to use your hands? What about your feet, or ear, or nose? What other materials could you find that conduct electricity that could be used in a switch?

## My Experience
I want to experiment with using github for Creative Computing as a blogging platform. It uses a modified Markdown language for Github specifically. It is fairly straight forward but it would require some effort to get used to the git workflow and Markdown again.

I reviewed the wrangling electrons post that would help creating a circuit. Unfortunately for me, arduino.cc is still "processing" my order and I dont expect it to receive it before 7/13/17 despite paying extra for shipping and handling. Even though, [Scott Fitzgerald](https://shfitz.gitbooks.io/creative-computing-summer-2017) is not getting any royalties off of the guide :), I would still like to read it. 

So, it gave me a nice chance to install and play with fritzing app (http://fritzing.org/). They seem to have a really slow server so I decided to download, compile and install from source which was a troubling task, considering they use QT and many other libraries that had to be compiled separately. Anyone, interested, can try to follow it at: [https://github.com/fritzing/fritzing-app/wiki] (https://github.com/fritzing/fritzing-app/wiki). I feel pretty good about developing a circuit on it. For a new user, it can be a bit overwhelming with so many options. I was a bit disappointed not see a simulator. I need to ask Scott if there is a different service that could test fritzing breadboards/schemas. Anyways, here is what I got:

This is the actual fritzing file:

Hopefully I will be ready to rumble in the next class.
