# Assignment 6
Make a physical controller or output for something you have made in p5.

I have tried to combine my first p5 assignment and my last arduino experiment of a light sensor.  I take a video stream and implement sort of a motion detection system. I was having difficulties comparing frames, so I loadpixel() of each frame as an image and copy it to a new array and compare them every single frame. Needless to say its a performance hit. If there are changes in rgb+opacity of any pixel, I send a signal down to my arduino that turns the alarm on. mp4 attached.

## Observation assignment:
Write on your journal a paragraph or two about what computing means to you at this point. Is it adding something to your life? Is it helping you become a better person? What are you getting out of it, what do others get from it?

Having been in the IT field for over 18 years, computing is no more than a tool to me to solve problems around me. Even though it has become synonymous to progress, something human is lost with overreliance on it. In my opinion, it has created more problems where people are connected digitally via social media but dont seem to have any more real interactions. It has made me a worse person, as I feel addicted to Twitter etc and cant close it to appreciate the smiles around me. My trip to lake george was a shining example, where members of family were more concerned about taking pictures and sharing them on the facebook rather than enjoying the moment and capturing it on the camera of one's memory.
